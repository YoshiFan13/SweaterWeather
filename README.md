# SweaterWeather
A simple weather Web app for a college project, tailored to my desires.

* 24 hour and 7 day forecasts
* Extra info such as sunrise/sunset, wind speed/direction...
* Choose between metric and imperial units
* Refresh info without reloading the entire app
* Supports iOS 11+ (or any major browser version since ~2018)
* Different background modes:
    * No background (black background)
    * Gradients
    * Weather photos from Unsplash
    * Featured photos from Unsplash
    * Custom image URL
    * Custom image upload (stored in LocalStorage)

## What it uses
* HTML5 + CSS3
* JavaScript + jQuery
* OpenWeatherMap API
* Google Fonts (Roboto)
* Unsplash Source
* [Weather Icons (Erik Flowers)](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons)

## Getting started
0. Sign up for OpenWeatherMap's free tier and get your API key [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
1. With your API key on hand, go to [the SweaterWeather page](https://yoshifan13.github.io/SweaterWeather)  
*(You can also host it yourself by downloading/cloning the repo and then starting a local server containing the files)*
2. Click/tap OK on the alert that says you're using the app for the first time  
*(Note for iOS: If you want to add SweaterWeather to your home screen, you can do it right after the alert appears and you won't have to set it up a second time)*
3. Enter your location in the topmost text field
4. Enter your API key in the bottommost text field
5. Click/tap on the checkmark in the bottom-right corner
6. Enjoy!
